This is a tetris game developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

This is a side project for me to improve my front-end dev. skills.

I used Jonhoo's code to begin and edited to implement my ideas.

You can see Jonhoo's code here.

First, I studied the original codes and made small changes (ie. replace var to let and make class)

I am not familiar with cavas and left it as is for now and concentrate my changes on other Javascript codes.
